Microservices, IoT and Azure Reference Implementation

This code repository is a reference implementation that accompanies the book Microservices, IoT and Azure by Bob Familiar and published by Apress Media. This project will launch in coordination with the release of the book.

 This book provides practical guidance for adopting a high velocity, continuous delivery process to create reliable, scalable, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions that are designed and built using a microservice architecture, deployed to the Azure cloud, and managed through automation. Microservices, IoT, and Azure offers software developers, architects, and operations engineers’ step-by-step directions for building SaaS applications—applications that are available 24×7, work on any device, scale elastically, and are resilient to change–through code, script, exercises, and a working reference implementation.

 The book provides a working definition of microservices and contrasts this approach with traditional monolithic Layered Architecture. A fictitious, home-biomedical startup is used to demonstrate microservice architecture and automation capabilities for cross-cutting and business services as well as connected device scenarios for Internet of Things (IoT). Several Azure PaaS services are detailed including Storage, SQL Database, DocumentDb, Redis Cache, Cloud Services, Web API’s, API Management, IoT Hub, IoT Suite, Event Hub, and Stream Analytics. Finally the book looks to the future and examines Service Fabric to see how microservices are becoming the de facto approach to building reliable software in the cloud.

 The Reference Implementation will provide PowerShell scripts to automate the Provisioning, Build, Deployment and De-Provisioning of the solution. The Solution consists of several independent Microservices built using C# and ASP.NET Web API along with DocumentDb and Redis. In addition there is an IoT component of the solution that is built using Event Hub, Stream Analytics, Cloud Services and SQL Database. There is a sample real-time data visualization client that demonstrates how to orchestrate the Microservices into a complete solution.

 Viewed as a whole, the Reference Implementation demonstrates how to use several Azure PaaS Services together along with custom code and automation scripts to create a modern Software-as-a-Service solution.
